TCP/IP 
    Used for network communication
    TCP - transmission control protocol
    IP - internet protocol 
    TCP - controls data exchange 
    IP - sends data from one device to another 
    Hosts 
    Devices on a network that have an IP

Network Address 
  Host address
  Each must be unique for proper routing 
  Address classes 
  Used to determine the network address and host address 
 
            Classful Networks
Class A
Network Address 
        1.0->127.0
        Ex. 17.24.88.9
Hosts allowed 16,777,216

Class B
Network Address 
        128.0-> 191.255
        Ex. 183.194.46.12
Hosts Allowed 65,536

Class C
Network Address 
        192.0.0 -> 233.255.255
        Ex. 199.83.123.123
Hosts Allowed 255


Subnet Mask for Each Class 
A
  255.0.0.0
B
  255.255.0.0
C
  255.255.255.0

The 255s are for the network address, the 0s are for host address 
Broadcast Address 
Turns the 0s in the subnet mask to 255

Classless Inter-Domain Routing = CIDR
    IP - 121.67.198.94
    Class A network - 121.0.0.0
    Class A subnet - 255.0.0.0
    Class A broadcast - 121.255.255.255
    IP - 121.67.198.94, if you specify subnet - 255.255.255.0
    CIDR network - 121.67.198.0 
    CIDR subnet - 255.255.255.0 (will stay the same)
    CIDR broadcast - 121.67.198.255(convert o to 255)

Networking 
    Determine your IP 
    Ip addr 
    Ip a 
    ip address show or ip a s 
    Ifconfig
    Hostname 
    Human-readable name for an IP 
    Webprod01 = 10.109.155.174 
    DNS(Domain Name System) Hostnames
    FQDN = Fully Qualified domain name 
    webprod01.mycompany.com 
    TLD(top level domain)
    .com, .net, .org
    Domains 
    below(to the left of) TLD 
    Sub-domain
    Below (to the left of) the domain
    Webprod01.ny.us.mycompany.com 
    Display Hostname
    Use the following commands 
    Hostname 
    uname -n -> same thing as hostname 
    hostname -f ->show FQDN



Setting the Hostname
  sudo Hostname newhostname
  You can also echo “newhostname’ > /etc/hostname
  Set Permanent Hostname 
      sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_name
       Then reboot and see if changes were saved 

Change computer name
Go to settings > sharing > edit name 


Resolving DNS Names - use both for IP and domain names 
    Host
    Dig
    The /etc/hosts file 
    Format:
    IP FQDN alias(es)
    10.11.12.13 web02.mycorp.com web02 
    Now you can refer to the host by name 
    Web02.mycorp.com or web02
    /etc/hosts is local to your linux system. It does not propagate to the rest of the network. 
    /etc/nsswitch.conf
    NSS = Name Service Switch 
    configuration file controls the order in which lookups are performed
    Controls the search order for resolutions 
    hosts : files dns
    hosts : files nis dns 
Network Ports
  When a service starts it binds itself to a port 
  Ports 1-1023 are well known ports 
      22- SSH
      25 - SMTP
      80 - Http
      143 - IMAP
      389 - LDAP
      443 - https 
      /etc/services 

DHCP
    Dynamic Host Configuration protocol 
    DHCP servers assign IP address to DHCP clients 
    IP address
    Netmask 
    Gateway
    DNS servers 
    Each IP is “leased” from the pool of IP addresses the DHCP server manages 
    The lease expiration is time configurable on the DHCP server (1 day,wk,etc) 
    The client must renew the lease if it wants to keep using the IP address. If no renewal is received, the IP is available to the other DHCP 
    Configuring a DHCP Client - RHEL 
    ifconfig -a or ip link

Configuring a DHCP CLient - Ubuntu 
    /etc/network/interfaces 
    Auto eth0
    Iface eth0 inet dhcp 
    Assigning a statil IP - RHEL
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

Assign static IP - Ubuntu 
    /etc/network/interfaces 
    Auto eth0
    Iface eth0 inet static(then provide the following:) 
    Address 
    Netmask 
    Gateway 
Manually Assigning an IP address
    Format - ip address
    Ip address add IP[/Netmask] dev NETWORK_DEVICE
    Ip address add 10.20.12.13 dev eth0
    Ip address add 10.2.3.4/255.255.255.0 dev eth0
    Ip link set eth0 up
    Format - ifconfig 
    Ifconfig Network_Device addr netmask Subnet_mask
    Ifconfig eth0 12.11.11.23
    ifconfig eth0 12.12.12.12 netmask 255.2255.255.0
    ifconfig eth0 up 
    ifup/ifdown
    Can be used inst4ead of ifconfig/ip
    Distribution dependent 
    Uses configuration files 
    Ex
    ifup eth0
    Ifup enp5s2 
    Ifdown eth0
    Ifdown enp5s2


Network Troubleshooting 
      Test connectivity 
      ping HOST
      Ping -c COUNT HOST
      Ping -c 3 google.com 
      Examine the route 
      traceroute -n google.com 
      Tracepath -n google.com
      Netstat - collect a lot of network stats 
      -n - display numerical addresses and ports 
      -i - displays a list of network interfaces 
      -r displays the route table - netstat -rn
      -p display the PID and program used (use sudo when using -p)
      -l display listening sockets - netstat -nlp
      -t - limit the output to TCP - netstat -ntlp
      -u - limit the output to UDP - netstat -nulp 
      tcpdump - packet sniffing wit htcpdump
      -n display numerical addresses and ports 
      -A display ASCII(text) output 
      -v - verbose mode - produce more output 
      -vvv - even more verbose output 
            You can also use telnet to connect to websites to verify connection
            Telnet HOST_OR_IP PORT_NUMBER
